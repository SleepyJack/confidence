Generate a brief topic (3-8 words) for a numerical trivia question.

The topic should describe something with a specific, verifiable number.

Good examples:
- depth of the Mariana Trench in meters
- population of Tokyo
- number of bones in the human body
- height of Mount Everest in feet
- year the Eiffel Tower was built

Bad examples (too vague or incomplete):
- "Earth's" (incomplete)
- "the number of" (incomplete)
- "interesting facts" (no specific topic)

Respond with ONLY the topic text. Do not include quotes, explanations, or preamble.
